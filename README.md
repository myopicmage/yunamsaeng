i'm learning korean!

remembering vocab is hard!

and there's no duolingo-style SRS for korean (well there's memrise and anki i guess?) so i wanted to build something that works the way i work.

this is a combination of my three favourite SRS systems (or it will be):

1. duolingo (love)
2. wanikani (if you want to learn kanji i highly recommend this)
3. anki (good old fashioned flash cards)

the idea is basically to keep track of when you should optimally review something but also review things as you feel you think you need to. want to review food? go for it! want to review things you haven't reviewed in a while? do that too!
